	<h1> The First Day Of School </h1>
	<p> I still remember the nervous excitement as i walked into the school gates with my books. The science lab stool tall and intimidiating ,but something about it felt like home .I was ready to become a science student.</p>
	<h2> My First Lab Coat </h2>
	<p> The first time i wore a lab coat, i felt like a scientist already . We were asked to perform a simple titration experiment. I did not know how to hold a pipette properly, but i pretended like i did. That day marked the beginning of my love for chemistry. </p>
	<h3> The Physics Surprise </h3>
	<p> Physics was tough at first. The equations , the calculations , and the laws , they made my spin . But one day, I solved a complicated circuit problem on the board and even my teacher was surprised. That day, I knew I could handle anything if I did not give up. </p>
	<h4> The Biology Sketchbook </h4>
	<p> Biology wasn't just about reading for me;it was are. I had a sketchbook filled with labeled diagrams ; the heart, the digestive system . </p>
	<h5> Group Project and Lab Accidents </h5>
	<p> Group project were fun, but lab accidents were not .Once ,someone spilled hydrochloric acid,and we have to evacuate the lab . It was scary ,but it also taught us to be more careful. </p>
	<h6> Graduation and Goodbyes </h6>
	<p> Before i knew it , we were throwing our lab coats in the air and saying goodbyes. Science had shape my mind and my friendship . I left with more than just knowledge .</p>
